# Java Script Eco System
The goal of this document is to teach the reader about JavaScript and itâ€™s eco system. I deliberately use the vague term eco system to prevent me having to precisely define the kinds of tools and techniques I am going to cover. While I might touch of some language features my goal is not to teach the reader how to program in JavaScript. Rather I intent to cover topic such as the following.

 * Where and how to execute JavaScript
 * How to debug JavaScript
 * How to use TypeScript to prevent
 * JavaScript modules
 * Developer tools

Each topic will be covered in a rather superficial manner. My goal is to show the user how to get a bare bones setup running and then, where appropriate, provide links to the relevant resources whether the user can find more depth. I am hence most aiming this article at professional developers who are used to using other languages and tools and who want to start using JavaScript.

## Execution Environments
JavaScript runs in a JavaScript execution engine. For the purposes of this document we will consider two commonly used execution environments 

 * Node.js commonly used for server side JavaScript
 * Chrome browser commonly used for client side JavaScript

 To install Node.js see this [Link](https://nodejs.org/en). Most users will want the LTS version. To install Chrome see this [Link](https://www.google.com/intl/en_in/chrome/)
